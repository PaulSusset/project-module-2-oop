# Game project

I made a game inspired by and featuring Teemo, a character from popular video game League of Legends.

The game is a basic dodge incoming enemies type.

There is a soundtrack that unfortunately is too big for the surge host. Run the project for the full experience!

The game engine was provided mostly complete with enemy creation and movement programmed.
